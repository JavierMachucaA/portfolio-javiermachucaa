# .ia-specs — AI-assisted implementation specs for this repo

This folder contains AI-friendly specifications, prompts and templates
for implementing, reviewing and generating frontend changes in this
portfolio project. Files here are adapted from the ai-specs pattern
to match the codebase in the repository root.

Usage:
- Use `frontend-spec.yaml` for a list of prioritized tasks.
- Use the prompts in `prompts/` when asking an AI to implement a task.
- Use `templates/` for consistent PR descriptions and change artifacts.

Maintainers: Javier Machuca
